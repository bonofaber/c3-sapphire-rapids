# Creating a computer vision system for remote environments with Roboflow and Intel C3 Sapphire Rapids

In this technical guide, we will walk through the process of building an autonomous river monitoring and cleaning system leveraging Roboflow to collect, label, and process visual data, then utilize Intel C3 Sapphire Rapids for model training and model deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Supervision (`supervision`)
- Requests (`requests`)
- Argparse (`argparse`) for command-line arguments

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python supervision requests argparse
```
